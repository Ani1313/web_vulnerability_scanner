# web_vulnerability_scanner

This Web Vulnerability Scanner helps to find vulnerabilities of WEB applications.
It scans to find possible injection points (XSS).

Before going through technical specification let’s  introduce program steps:
  1.Goes into every possible page in a given URL
  2.Software looks for ways to send data
  3.Sends payloads to discover vulnerabilities
  4.Analyzes the response to check if the given app is vulnerable or not 

Technical details

  1. EXTRACT_LINKS_FROM – takes as a parameter some URL and extracts all possible links in that given page.

  2. CRAWL-takes as a parameter a URL, and basically, it gives us unique links and links that are not external. Also, there are links that in the source code are starting with #. Our function takes into consideration these links, too. All links it stores in the list named target_lists. When it is done, it goes to explore each new link. In other words, it recursively lists all links starting from a target_url.

  3.  EXTRACT_FORMS – this function extracts all forms in the given Web application and returns it in a list.

  4.  SUBMIT_FORM – this function submits a given form and sends requests to the given link
  5.  TEST_XSS_IN_FORM - this function injects javascript code into the given page through forms and analyzes the response to understand whether that page is vulnerable for XSS or not.

  6.  TEST_XSS_IN_LINK-this is basically doing the same job as the TEST_XSS_IN_FORM function, but it injects through URL.

  7.  RUN_SCANNER- it calls TEST_XSS_IN_FORM and TEST_XSS_IN_LINK functions to test functions on all collected URLs in the targetes_urls list and prints the results.
